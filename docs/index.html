<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The recent developments in robotics demand tackling high complexity
in modeling rigid body systems. Series-parallel hybrid robots can be
defined as a combination of series or tree-type chains and parallel
mechanisms. While there are many advantages of having such hybrid
robots, the kinematic complexities are inherited from the serial and
parallel robots. The number of holonomic constraints increases with
number and complexity of closed-loop mechanism. Hence, it becomes very
important to resolve the loop closures in such hybrid robots in a
computationally efficient and error free manner.</p>
<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>In most of the numerical approaches, the aim is to solve the implicit
constraints as they are fairly easy to setup at acceleration level. As
the loop closures in the system increases, loop closure errors are
inevitable and the approach suffers from computational inefficiency. On
the other hand, explicit constraints are complex to setup as it requires
the knowledge of analytical solutions to loop closure equations but
overcomes the problem of computational inefficiency and numerical
errors.</p>
<p>This motivates us to combine the complementary nature of numerical
and analytical loop closure methods to develop a hybrid
numerical-analytical approach which exploits the modularity in the
system design and the analytical solutions to loop closure constraints
in commonly studied parallel mechanisms. The approach offers higher
model fidelity and computational performance than a purely numerical
treatment of complex series-parallel hybrid robots.</p>
<h2 id="approach">Approach</h2>
<p>In Fig. below, the blue column follows the derivation of implicit
constraints via numerical approach and orange column follows the
derivation of explicit constraints via symbolic expressions for
resolving the loop closures. The green layer between them depicts the
idea of deriving the explicit constraints from implicit constraints
numerically. This modular approach gives freedom to a user to choose a
numerical or analytical approach for a parallel submechanism module.
Hence, if the constraints are requested to be resolved numerically, they
are expressed in explicit form using the green layer in the figure. On
the contrary, if analytical approach is requested by the user, symbolic
expressions are required for that particular parallel module.</p>

<h2 id="example">Example</h2>
Let us consider a reduced version of RH5 Manus robot as an example of
series-parallel hybrid robot. In Fig. below, the hybrid system is
represented as a serial composition of eight submechanisms, defined by
the user. Among these, blue circled are closed loop submechanisms while
others are serial chain subsystems. The first closed loop submechanism
connected to the root of graph represents torso of the robot. It is a
multi-loop mechanism of type 2S<span
style="text-decoration:underline">P</span>U+1U actuated by two prismatic
joints. Additionally, the elbow of robot is realized with a closed loop
mechanism of type RR<span style="text-decoration:underline">P</span>R
actuated with a prismatic joint. From the figure, the user can solve
some closed loop mechanisms numerically and remaning analytically.
Example, solving torso mechanism numerically and remaining elbow
mechanisms using the availble symbolic expression.

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>
<p>The computational performance is measured in CPU time. A total number
of 10000 calls were made to solve the full system state (position,
velocity, acceleration), inverse dynamics, and forward dynamics. The
program is run on a standard laptop with Ubuntu 20.04 operating system
and Intel Core i9-11950H CPU @ 2.6 GHz.</p>
<h3 id="reduced-rh5-manus-robot-model">Reduced RH5 Manus Robot
Model</h3>
<p>For the reduced version of the RH5 Manus robot with 23 spanning tree
joints (as in Fig. 2.), CPU time is noted for position, velocity,
acceleration, and torque analysis for randomly generated trajectories.
For computational performance, three cases are studied where</p>
<ul>
<li>The full system is solved through numerical approach using RBDL
(No. of contraints = 10).</li>
<li>The full system is solved through analytical approach using
HyRoDyn.</li>
<li>The full system is solved through proposed approach where one closed
loop mechanism (torso mechanism in Fig. 2) is solved numerically and
other parallel mechanisms are solved analytically. (No. of contraints =
6)</li>
</ul>

</figure>
<p>The computational performance for the numerical approach from RBDL is
<span class="math inline">\(\approx 5\)</span> times slower than the
analytical approach from HyRoDyn. Also, it can be noted that proposed
numerical-analytical approach performs <span
class="math inline">\(\approx 2\)</span> times better than the purely
numerical approach from RBDL which shows the advantage of the proposed
method.</p>
<h3 id="full-upper-body-of-rh5-manus-model">Full Upper body of RH5 Manus
Model</h3>
<p>The computational performance is studied for the fixed-base full
upper body of RH5 Manus robot model (61 spanning tree joints, 20
independent joints, and 20 actuated joints) with a parallel wrist
mechanism whose symbolic expressions are not yet available in the
database of HyRoDyn software. Following cases are studied:</p>
<ul>
<li>The full system is solved through numerical approach from RBDL
including the wrist (No. of contraints = 30).</li>
<li>The full system is solved through proposed approach where only wrist
is solved numerically (No. of contraints = 20).</li>
</ul>
